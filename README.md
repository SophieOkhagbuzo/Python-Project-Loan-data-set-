# Python-Project-Loan-data-set-
Python Project
In this Python project, I analyzed a loan dataset to identify key factors affecting loan approval decisions. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the use of machine learning models. I handled missing values, visualized patterns in the data, and built a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval based on factors like credit history, income, loan amount, and applicant demographics. The project provided insights into the loan approval process and improved decision-making accuracy through data-driven predictions.
